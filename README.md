# EDSAC-FORTRAN-Compiler

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ElliotAlexander/EDSAC-FORTRAN-Compiler.svg?token=j8JEQQabqLSg3UrAnJoU&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ElliotAlexander/EDSAC-FORTRAN-Compiler)

A FORTRAN II Compiler for the EDSAC machine reconstruction project. 

This project aims to implement FORTRAN 2 (II) on EDSAC by way of a cross-compiler, capable of compiling FORTRAN II programs for execution on the EDSAC machine. 

This project is **no longer maintained**.

I wrote this as a part of my third year dissertation project at the University of Southampton. If you've any interest in this project, or are looking to get it running, do contact me directly. It's generally some fairly awful C++, and is an absolute pain to get running, though there's a lot of (difficult to find) information about FORTRAN II and EDSAC itself in here.
